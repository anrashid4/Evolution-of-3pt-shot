# NBA_Project

For this project, I downloaded two nba datasets from Kaggle and began cleaning them up. In order to clean them, I used Python in Jupyter notebook along with the Pandas package. This ensured that the CSV files would be imported properly and that I could manipulate them in the most efficient way possible. After cleaning both datasets and merging them, I then exported the merged dataset to its own csv file. I uploaded this newly made csv file to Tableau where I created the visualization attached to this project. 

This visualization displays just how dramatically the 3 point line has affected the NBA. For each position, I took some of the top players from those positions and compared their 3 point attempt percentage for 3 seasons. Most of the players had a significant increase in 3 point attempt percentage, while some are still attempting around the same amount. One player who immensely increased his 3 point attempt percentage is Nikola Vucevic (center) who went from attempting 7% of his shots as threes to nearly 24% the following season. 

One possible aspect I could have considered when creating this visualization is the systems that these NBA players were in. For example, Chris Paul joined the Houston Rockets in 2017 and his 3 point attempt percentage increased from 38% to nearly 47% because of Mike D'Antoni's coaching philosophy.
